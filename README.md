## Installation

You don't have to install this package, as it'll be delivered with the latest appserver.io 
release. If you want to install it with your application only, you do this by add

```sh
{
    "require": {
        "appserver-io-psr/deployment": "dev-master"
    },
}
```

to your ```composer.json``` and invoke ```composer update``` in your project.

## Usage

Coming soon!
